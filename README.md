Here’s a detailed and structured README file for your project. It outlines the purpose, features, setup, usage, and other relevant details.

Hermit Engagement Toolkit

I created this Hermit Engagement Toolkit after finding some older bash script that I thought was interesting. 
I got the idea from here https://blog.stackattack.net/2018/01/03/pentest-aliases-and-setup/ 
This is the first .py I've made and addmittedly had a lot of help from the web and some AI, maybe it will be helpful to someone else
just like it was helpful to the person with the original idea.

Overview

The Hermit Engagement Toolkit is a Python script designed to assist in penetration testing engagements by:

	•	Logging commands and their outputs.
 
	•	Taking timestamped notes.
 
	•	Parsing Nmap scan results for actionable insights.
 
	•	Creating an organized directory structure for engagement files.

This script simplifies logging and reporting tasks while providing a clean and structured approach to managing pentest data.

Features:

	1.	Log Commands:
	•	Run and log commands with timestamps and outputs.
 
 	•	Save logs for future reference.
 
	2.	Take Notes:
 
	•	Add timestamped notes to a centralized log file.
 
	3.	Parse Nmap Results:
 
	•	Extract open ports and associated IPs from Nmap output.
 
	•	Filter results by port or service.
 
	•	Save a summary in CSV format for easy reporting.
 
	4.	Directory Management:
 
	•	Automatically creates and maintains an organized directory structure:

~/engagement/

├── helpers/

├── logs/

└── nmap_results/


Requirements

	•	Operating System: Linux (tested on Kali Linux).
 
	•	Python Version: Python 3.6 or later.

Installation

	1.	Clone or Download the Script:
 
	•	Save the script as hermit_engagement.py in a directory of your choice.
 
	2.	Optional: Create a scripts directory:

mkdir -p ~/scripts
mv hermit_engagement.py ~/scripts/


	3.	Make the Script Executable (Optional):

chmod +x ~/scripts/hermit_engagement.py


	4.	Add to PATH (Optional):
	•	Open ~/.bashrc:

nano ~/.bashrc


	•	Add the following line:

export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"


	•	Reload the shell:

source ~/.bashrc


	5.	Run the Script:

python3 ~/scripts/hermit_engagement.py

Usage

When you run the script, you’ll see the following menu:

Choose an option:
1) Log a command (alias: lc)
2) Add a note (alias: an)
3) Find Nmap targets (alias: fnt)
4) Exit (alias: exit)
Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, 4, or alias):

Menu Options
	1.	Log a Command:
	•	Enter any shell command (e.g., ls -la).
	•	The command’s output and runtime will be logged in ~/engagement/logs/command-log.<date>.txt.
	2.	Add a Note:
	•	Enter any note or observation.
	•	The note will be saved with a timestamp in ~/engagement/logs/notes-log.txt.
	3.	Find Nmap Targets:
	•	Provide the path to an Nmap scan result file.
	•	Optionally filter by port or service.
	•	Results will be saved in:
	•	~/engagement/logs/nmap-targets.txt: Extracted targets (IP:PORT:SERVICE).
	•	~/engagement/logs/nmap-summary.csv: Summary of open ports and associated IPs.
	4.	Exit:
	•	Close the script.

Directory Structure

When the script runs, it creates the following directories under ~/engagement:
	•	helpers/: Reserved for helper scripts or tools.
	•	logs/: Stores command logs, notes, and Nmap results.
	•	nmap_results/: For storing raw Nmap outputs (optional use).

Example Workflow
	1.	Log a Command:
	•	Select option 1 and enter a shell command like ls -la.
	•	View the logged output in ~/engagement/logs/command-log.<date>.txt.
	2.	Add Notes:
	•	Select option 2 and enter details like “Scanned subnet 192.168.1.0/24.”
	3.	Parse Nmap Results:
	•	Select option 3 and provide the path to an Nmap output file.
	•	View extracted results in ~/engagement/logs/nmap-targets.txt and ~/engagement/logs/nmap-summary.csv.
	4.	Organized Output:
	•	All logs and summaries are saved under ~/engagement/logs.

Example Nmap Result Parsing

Input

Discovered open port 22/tcp on 192.168.1.10
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 192.168.1.20
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 192.168.1.20

Output
	1.	Targets (~/engagement/logs/nmap-targets.txt):

192.168.1.10:22:ssh
192.168.1.20:80:http
192.168.1.20:443:https


	2.	Summary (~/engagement/logs/nmap-summary.csv):

Port,Number of IPs,IP List
22,1,192.168.1.10
80,1,192.168.1.20
443,1,192.168.1.20

Troubleshooting

Common Issues
	1.	Python Not Found:
	•	Ensure Python 3 is installed:

sudo apt install python3


	2.	Script Not Running:
	•	Ensure you’re in the correct directory or provide the full path:

python3 ~/scripts/hermit_engagement.py


	3.	Nmap File Not Found:
	•	Ensure the provided file path to the Nmap results is correct.

Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
	•	Integration with other tools (e.g., Metasploit, Burp Suite).
	•	Automated report generation.
	•	Support for additional file formats (e.g., XML Nmap outputs).
